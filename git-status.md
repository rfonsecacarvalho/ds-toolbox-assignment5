 # Definition: git status

The `git status` command is a utility for checking the current state of a Git repository. It provides information about which files have changes that are staged for commit, which files have changes that are not staged, and which files are not being tracked by Git. It's an essential tool for developers to see what's happening in their project and to review what will be included in the next commit.

The command is particularly useful for:

- Ensuring that new changes are recognized by Git.
- Verifying which changes are staged for a commit.
- Checking for any files that might have been changed or added that you do not wish to commit.

To access similar information in the JupyterLab IDE, you can use the Git extension for JupyterLab. Once installed, it integrates ith the IDE and provides a graphical interface for Git operations. It shows the status of files in the current repository, allowing  to stage and commit changes, push and pull from remote repositories, and switch between branches.
